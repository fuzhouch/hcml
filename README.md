# HCML

It's a fun project to learn Rust programming and Machine Learning.
The plan is to implement the classic machine learning algorithms with
hand-written Rust. The planned algorithms are listed as below:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Logistic regression

## How to build

1. Clone the code: ``git clone https://github.com/fuzhouch/hcml``.
2. Build code: ``cargo build`` 
3. Download [EMINST dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist/data)
